# Design - Color

### DECIDING ON COLORS

Color palettes often follow a set of rules to make them more cohesive:

- Monochromatic — Variations on a single hue

- Analogous — Hues equidistant from each other (usually adjacent) on the color wheel and variations on these

- Complementary — Hues opposite each other on the color wheel and variations on these

### ACCESSIBLE COLORS

You can learn more about color blindness [here](http://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness).

You can use tools such as [Color Laboratory](http://colorlab.wickline.org/colorblind/colorlab) to emulate color-blindness as you're making decisions about your color palette.

### COLOR ON WEB PAGES

To choose text colors from your palette, find two contrasting colors within your palette, one dark and one light. Use one for the text and the other for the background.

Organize each element by importance. Then, apply the most striking colors to the most important elements.

# Design - Typography

#### BACKGROUND

- font - refers to a typeface at a specific size

- typeface - describes a grouping of all sizes and styles of a specific typeface

#### SELECTING TYPEFACES FOR SITE DESIGN

###### SERIF VERSUS SANS-SERIF TYPEFACES

- serifs are very often employed by reading-focussed sites, such as news sites and blogs

- sans-serif fonts have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens

###### PAIRING TYPEFACES

- if you select a typeface on Google Fonts, at the bottom of the page you will be given suggested typeface pairings

The following resources provide in-depth advice on pairing fonts:

#### UTILIZING FONTS TO CONVEY CONTENT AND TONE

###### ESTABLISHING A VISUAL HIERARCHY

Typography should support at least three levels of hierarchy.

1. The primary level is for the most important content/information
2. The secondary level is to help organize your design into sections
3. The tertiary level is the meat of the design

###### SCALING

It is preferable to use ems and rems whenever possible.

###### LEADING AND TRACKING

Leading and tracking are tools to help make sure your text is readable.

Leading is the spacing between lines of text.

- Using the CSS property `line-height`, you can make sure your lines are not crammed together or too far apart.

Tracking is the space between letters throughout a word.

- `letter-spacing`
