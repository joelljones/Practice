# Introduction to JavaScript

- `//` single-line comment

- `console.log();` command is used to print, or log, text to the console

- A semicolon is used to mark the end of a statement.

- Variables can store any data type, including strings, numbers, and booleans.

  - `var` indicates the creation of a variable

- Mathematical expressions include the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.

- A function is a block of code that performs a task.

  ```JavaScript
  function functionName() {
    // a set of instructions that will only execute when the function is called
  }

  functionName(); // To call a function, you need the function's name, a pair of parentheses, and a semicolon.
  ```

- Methods are functions that perform a task on an object.

- Comparison operators compare values and return a boolean value (`true` or `false`). The operators include: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, and `!==`.

- Logical operators combine multiple boolean expressions or values to provide a single boolean output. The operators include `&&` and `||`.

- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) execute code if a set of conditions are met.

- Arrays are lists of JavaScript values.

- Arrays are zero-indexed. Each item can be accessed using bracket (`[]`) notation and its numeric position.

- `for` loops execute for a set number of iterations.

  ```JavaScript
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log('log/print something');
  }
  ```

  1. Within the `for` loop's parentheses, the _start condition_ is `var i = 0`, which means the loop starts counting at `0`.
  1. The _stop condition_ is `i < 3`, which means the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `3`. When `i` is equal to `3`, the loop will stop.
  1. The _iterator_ is `i++`. This means that `i` increases by one after each loop â€” `i++` is equivalent to writing `i = i + 1;`.
  1. Finally, the code block inside the curly braces executes until the loop stops.

- `while` loops execute as long as a certain condition is met.

  ```JavaScript
  var count = 5;
  while (count < 10){
    console.log('log/print something');
    count++;
  }
  ```

- Objects are like arrays, but use strings as keys to access their contents instead of position indices. Functions that are associated with an object are called methods.

  ```JavaScript
  var scoreboard = {
    teamA: 'Code',
    teamB: 'Cademy',
    scoreA: 0,
    scoreB: 0,
    incrementScoreA: function () {
      scoreboard.scoreA++;
    },
    incrementScoreB: function(){
      scoreboard.scoreB++;
    }
  };
  ```
